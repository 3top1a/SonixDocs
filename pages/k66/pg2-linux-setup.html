			<h1>Environment Setup - Linux</h1>
			<p>We need to setup the environment for QMK, however as we already have a UNIX environment this should be a bit simpler. The QMK linux installation file currently supports Fedora, Ubuntu/Debian, Arch, (install) Gentoo, Sabayon, OpenSUSE, Slackware, Solus and Void.</p>
			<h2>1.) Install Git</h2>
			<p>Pretty self explanatory, if you don't already have it. Install git using your distributions package manager.</p>
			<h2>2.) Clone the modified version of QMK.</h2>
			<p>Make a directory with <code>mkdir womier</code> and go into it with<code>cd womier</code>. Run this command to clone our modification of QMK. We have a special branch in a fork so you cannot use unmodified QMK right now.</p> 
			<code>git clone -b womier-k66-rgb-support --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/smp4488/qmk_firmware.git</code>
			<h2>3.) Installation of drivers and other necessary applications.</h2>
			<p>QMK includes a helpful script which installs all the different dependencies required to compile. First we will need to go into the cloned qmk_firmware directory.</p>
			<code>cd qmk_firmware/</code>
			<p>That was easy enough, now we need to run the script.</p>
			<code>./util/linux_install.sh</code>
			<p>When this is fully complete and has no errors, you will need to exit out of your terminal emulator or current tab and open it back up again to reload. Go back to the cloned qmk_firmware directory. Once this is done move on to the next page by pressing the big button below.</p>
