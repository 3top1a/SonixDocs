	<h1>Flashing the firmware to the Womier K66</h1>
	<p>Flashing is arguably the most exciting part of this process. Please make sure you do all of this in the correct order or you risk bricking your board.</p>

	<h2>Follow these steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Plug in the Womier K66 and press the <b>refresh</b> button. In the drop down select <b>Womier K66</b>. If there are multiple options that say "Womier K66", try the next step for each of them until the keyboard stops responding.</li>
		<li>Press "Reboot to Bootloader". The keyboard should stop responding if you did it correctly.</li>
		<li>Press "Flash Jumploader". This will flash the utility which starts up QMK.</li>
		<li>Alright, this is the moment you have been waiting for. Press the "Flash QMK" and then select the .bin file that is located in qmk_firmware/.build/.</li>
