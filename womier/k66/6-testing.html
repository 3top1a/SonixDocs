	<h1>Testing the Womier K66</h1>
	<p>If everything worked you should notice some changes, test them now!</p>

	<ol>
		<li>The caps lock key should now be a FN key.</li>
		<li>You can use the keybind <b>CAPS + S + 1/2</b> to change the RGB effect.</li>
		<li>You can use the keybind <b>CAPS + S + Insert/Delete</b> to change the brightness of the RGB</li>
	</ol>
	<p>There are a few more changes with the layout which you can see <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/ad1771ca6ecfa0f145ae5c6744bbf334">here</a></p>
	<p>If you dislike the default keybinds or layout, you will need to modify the QMK keymap file located at <code>keyboards/womier/k66/keymaps/default/keymap.c</code>. Thankfully to rebuild you just need to repeat the make command when we built QMK. Push the button to go to QMK's website to learn more about keymaps. If you ever have any questions please join our discord server on the top of the page. Thank you so much for reading.</p>
