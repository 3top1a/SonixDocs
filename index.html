	<h1>Sonix Documentation</h1>
	<p>
	The Sonix QMK community has ported many Sonix MCU boards from the like of womier, redragon and keychron to the open source keyboard firmware QMK. This website assists you with installation of QMK and gives information on the boards. We would like to remind you that QMK, Sonix nor the manufacturers of these boards have any association with this website. Please understand that the Sonix QMK is full of volunteers and we cannot help you with every issue, please attempt to figure it out on your own. Have fun!
