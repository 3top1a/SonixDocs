			<h1>Installing QMK on the Womier keyboards</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the Womier Docs website! We made this resource to make installation of QMK a breeze on this fantastic low-cost keyboard. QMK is an open source firmware which gives many great features such as custom layouts, custom rgb patterns and even macros. Our goal for this website is to make it easy to understand installation. If you ever have any problem please join our discord (link at the top) and ask away in the <b>#firmware</b> channel. Please remember that this project is not owned or operated by Womier or the QMK project and this must be done at your own risk. If you brick your board it will require a SWD programmer. With that out of the way, have fun with QMK!</p>
